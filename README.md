# Hacktoberfest

## What is this all about?

The intent of Hacktoberfest is to help support and grow the open source community. All backgrounds, regardless of skillsets and expertise are welcome. There is something for everyone!

By the end, you should be the proud owner of a GitHub account, and enough know-how to engage with the community and contribute back.

## Why bother?

### Build relationships with passionate individuals
The majority of open source projects are built and maintained by individuals who do it because they're passionate about it. More often than not they are estatic to have help, and will welcome any efforts you put towards their project.

### Exposure to a wide variety of problems
Open source is a lot like the wild west. Projects are written in different languages, have different workflows, and approaches to solving problems. If you've always been curious about a specific language or technology, there's an open source project for that!

### Have a voice for how software is made
With the software we use being out in the open, you have the power to recommend approaches and suggest changes. If your software does not do everything you want it to, add an issue to the repository, or better yet add a pull request.

## The wordy stuff

### It's just Git

Azure DevOps. GitLab. BitBucket. They're all just ways of interacting with **git**. If you're familiar with git, picking up these software suites are just a matter of learning the UI. Concepts such as: commit, pull request, and *fork* are all what you would expect.

### Forks

If you're working on your own code, you probably don't need to fork. But in the scenario where you need to work on someone else's code, forking is a best practice.

Forking enables you to work on your own local copy of the source, and only push the parts of the code that you touched. Otherwise, you'd have to pollute the upstream with branches and create unnessary noise.

## The fun stuff
