# Hacktoberfest

![](images/hacktoberfest.jpg)

## What is this all about?

The intent of Hacktoberfest is to help support and grow the open source community. All backgrounds, regardless of skillsets and expertise are welcome. There is something for everyone!

By the end, you should be the proud owner of a GitHub account, and enough know-how to engage with the community and contribute back.

Contribute enough, and you can be the proud owner of a Hacktoberfest T-Shirt and other swag.

## Why bother?

### Build relationships with passionate individuals
The majority of open source projects are built and maintained by individuals who do it because they're passionate about it. More often than not they are estatic to have help, and will welcome any efforts you put towards their project.

These connections last, and can greatly help you in your career.

### Exposure to a wide variety of problems
Open source is a lot like the wild west. Projects are written in different languages, have different workflows, and approaches to solving problems. If you've always been curious about a specific language or technology, there's an open source project for that!

_Reference:_ .. I think we're good on this one.

### Have a voice for how software is made
With the software we use being out in the open, you have the power to recommend approaches and suggest changes. If your software does not do everything you want it to, add an issue to the repository, or better yet add a pull request.

_Reference:_ [ACR Docker Labels](https://github.com/Azure/acr/issues/247)

### Fix issues sooner and avoid hacks
Often times the software we depend on has bugs, and we have to work around them in one way or another. Instead of implementing a workaround, you have the power to fix the root cause! This is not only a cleaner solution, but we're not the only ones who are (or will) experience the problem.

### There's something for everyone
GitHub hosts more than just software. Many of the supporting documentation also lives in GitHub. You don't have to be a programmer to contribute!

## The wordy stuff

### It's just Git

Azure DevOps. GitLab. BitBucket. They're all just facilitate ways of interacting with **git**. If you're familiar with git, picking up these software suites are just a matter of learning the UI. 

Concepts such as: commit, pull request, and *fork* should be what you would expect.

### Forks

If you're working on your own code, you probably don't need to fork. But in the scenario where you need to work on someone else's code, forking is a best practice.

Forking enables you to work on your own local copy of the source, and only push the parts of the code that you touched. Otherwise, you'd have to pollute the [upstream](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2739376/definition-of-downstream-and-upstream) with branches and create unnecessary noise.

## Looking for more?

During Hacktoberfest, most GitHub repositories will label issues that they feel are a good fit with `Hacktoberfest`.

If you're interested in contributing even more, you can find all of the issues with the `Hacktoberfest` label [here](https://github.com/search?q=label%3Ahacktoberfest+state%3Aopen+is%3Aissue&type=Issues).

## So.. I'm still lost

If you're looking for something more step-by-step, this repository has some documentation showcasing how to fork repositories and commit to an upstream.
